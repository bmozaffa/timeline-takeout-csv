# timeline-takeout-csv
Google Maps Timeline exported through Takeout and converted to CSV file

Go to https://takeout.google.com/ to export your timeline and unzip the file on your local system. This code expects a Takeout directory on your Desktop. Running it will aggregate all visited places into a single CSV file in that same directory, as well as all transit segments in a CSV filed called activities.
